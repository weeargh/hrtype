# Coding and Design Conventions

This document outlines the coding and design conventions for the 'What Kind of HR Manager Are You?' quiz application.

## General

*   Follow principles of clean code: readable, maintainable, and simple.
*   Use consistent naming conventions.
*   Comment non-obvious code.

## HTML

*   Use semantic HTML5 tags where appropriate.
*   Ensure accessibility (e.g., ARIA attributes if needed later).
*   Indent code consistently (e.g., 4 spaces).

## CSS

*   Use a consistent naming convention for classes and IDs (e.g., BEM or kebab-case).
*   Organize CSS logically (e.g., by component or section).
*   Avoid overly specific selectors.
*   Consider mobile-first design if applicable.

## JavaScript

*   Use modern JavaScript (ES6+ features).
*   Write modular code (functions, classes where appropriate).
*   Use meaningful variable and function names.
*   Handle errors gracefully.
*   For DOM manipulation, cache frequently accessed elements.
*   Indent code consistently (e.g., 4 spaces).

## JSON (`questions.json`)

*   Ensure valid JSON format.
*   Maintain the defined structure for questions, options, and mappings.

*(Further conventions to be added as the project evolves)*
